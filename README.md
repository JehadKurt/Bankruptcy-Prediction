# Bankruptcy-Prediction
Project Title: Predicting Bankruptcy with High Accuracy Using Machine Learning Models and Interactive GUI

Project Description:

Overview:
In this project, I have developed a robust solution for predicting bankruptcy using machine learning models. The primary goal was to create an accurate bankruptcy prediction system with an accuracy rate exceeding 95%. To achieve this, I employed three different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Tree. Additionally, I designed a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to enable users to easily interact with the models and view prediction results.

Key Features:

Dataset: I utilized a labeled dataset containing bankruptcy data, with binary labels 'yes' and 'no,' representing whether a company went bankrupt or not.

Model Selection:

Logistic Regression: This model is well-suited for binary classification tasks and is known for its simplicity and interpretability.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is a powerful algorithm for classification tasks, capable of handling complex decision boundaries.
Decision Tree: Decision trees are intuitive and can capture non-linear relationships in the data.
Training and Evaluation: I trained each of the three models using the labeled dataset and fine-tuned their hyperparameters to optimize performance. The models were evaluated using various metrics, with a primary focus on achieving an accuracy rate of over 95%.

Graphical User Interface (GUI):

I created an interactive GUI that provides a user-friendly interface for utilizing the trained models.
The GUI features buttons to select and run each of the three models.
Users can input data or load data for prediction, and the GUI displays the results.
The interface provides real-time accuracy and prediction results, making it easy for users to assess the model's performance.
High Accuracy: The project's main success criterion was achieving an accuracy rate above 95%, ensuring that the bankruptcy prediction system provides reliable results.

Impact and Future Work:

This project's success in achieving a high accuracy rate in predicting bankruptcy has significant implications for financial analysts, investors, and business decision-makers. It can assist in identifying high-risk companies and making informed investment and lending decisions.

Future work may include:

Expanding the dataset and exploring more advanced machine learning models.
Implementing feature selection techniques to improve model performance and reduce dimensionality.
Enhancing the GUI with additional features, such as data visualization and predictive analytics.
In summary, this project combines the power of machine learning with a user-friendly interface to provide a highly accurate bankruptcy prediction tool. It has the potential to aid financial professionals in making well-informed decisions regarding investments and lending practices.
